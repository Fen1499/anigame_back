apparently there's something called GORM for connecting to a dabatase, I kind of wanna start there

nvm, I'll use a connect, seriously f*ck ORM, also some useful information for myself https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#Open

I need to draw a model but as soon as a login into windows I'll go into star rail...

coming back after a long time, wrote some structs, have to do the DB model at some point and a script to populate the DB

I made a table, made some models need to populate the DB now, creating something like an MVP should be easy

Got some data, I want a script that queries and also inserts it into the database like it's seeding from the web
Problem: psycopg2 kinda sucks and I'm not sure I want to use venv for this one single dependecy, ideally I wouldn't have any python dependecy

A few days later and after some consideration I might just get it on a json file and then write it on the database

A LOT OF TIME HAS PASSED, I think I'm gonna do both, write it into a file that has the full query but I also wanna try go and write is through psql with subsprocess.run()

Not sure I'll work on subprocess rn, think I'm gonna look into some integration with the database first and my old golang code

It's saturday lol
Gonna look into connection to the database
I'll probably be using something different than pgsql when hosting it, won't worry about it for now
Howeaver I can see something unusual coming, like an actual usage of clean code of watheaver
I managed to make the connection work, took like an hour? idk, too much time as connecting to the db is always a pain

It's saturday...anyways I need away to randomize the picked anime if I don't have an anime of the day
The standard web approach would be easy, just check if there's a daily for that day it there isn't then create it
Thinking about it now, the frontend will still query to check for a UserDaily and then create or get,
or should I keep it all in the storage?

Big thinking time
